# ConwaysGameOfLife
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life

I was doing a revision on old master's courses and found slides on Cellular Automata and Conway's Game of Life.
Found that it would be fun to spend a few hours and implement it.
(Note: about 6-7h split between 2 days for the first commit)
